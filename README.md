# About
If you use this API, you can easily check the profiles of 140 Harry Potter characters. You can also delete the characters you don't like and put your name in the database as a new character!

# Getting Started
Follow this guide to set up your environment.
To clone and run this application, you'll need Node.js, npm and postgreSQL installed on your computer.

1. Create a database and a table.
Create a database called `harrypotterapi`.
And in the database, create a table named `harrypotter` as follows.
```
     Column  |          Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
-------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 id          | integer                |           | not null | 
 name        | character varying(100) |           | not null | 
 gender      | character varying(6)   |           |          | 
 job         | character varying(50)  |           |          | 
 house       | character varying(50)  |           |          | 
 wand        | character varying(200) |           |          | 
 patronus    | character varying(50)  |           |          | 
 species     | character varying(100) |           |          | 
 bloodstatus | character varying(100) |           |          | 
 haircolour  | character varying(100) |           |          | 
 eyecolour   | character varying(100) |           |          | 
 loyalty     | character varying(200) |           |          | 
 skills      | character varying(200) |           |          | 
 birth       | character varying(100) |           |          | 
 death       | character varying(100) |           |          | 
```

2. Clone this repo and install dependencies
